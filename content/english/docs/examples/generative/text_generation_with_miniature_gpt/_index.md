## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to implement an autoregressive language model using a miniature version of the GPT model. The model consists of a single Transformer block with causal masking in its attention layer. We use the text from the IMDB sentiment classification dataset for training and generate new movie reviews for a given prompt. When using this script with your own dataset, make sure it has at least 1 million words.

This example should be run with `tf-nightly>=2.3.0-dev20200531` or with TensorFlow 2.3 or higher.

## Setup

```python
# We set the backend to TensorFlow. The code works with
# both `tensorflow` and `torch`. It does not work with JAX
# due to the behavior of `jax.numpy.tile` in a jit scope
# (used in `causal_attention_mask()`: `tile` in JAX does
# not support a dynamic `reps` argument.
# You can make the code work in JAX by wrapping the
# inside of the `causal_attention_mask` function in
# a decorator to prevent jit compilation:
# `with jax.ensure_compile_time_eval():`.

## Implement a Transformer block as a layer

```python
def causal_attention_mask(batch_size, n_dest, n_src, dtype):
    """
    Mask the upper half of the dot product matrix in self attention.
    This prevents flow of information from future tokens to current token.
    1's in the lower triangle, counting from the lower right corner.
    """
    i = ops.arange(n_dest)[:, None]
    j = ops.arange(n_src)
    m = i >= j - n_src + n_dest
    mask = ops.cast(m, dtype)
    mask = ops.reshape(mask, [1, n_dest, n_src])
    mult = ops.concatenate(
        [ops.expand_dims(batch_size, -1), ops.convert_to_tensor([1, 1])], 0
    )
    return ops.tile(mask, mult)


class TransformerBlock(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.att = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads, embed_dim)
        self.ffn = keras.Sequential(
            [
                layers.Dense(ff_dim, activation="relu"),
                layers.Dense(embed_dim),
            ]
        )
        self.layernorm1 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.layernorm2 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)
        self.dropout1 = layers.Dropout(rate)
        self.dropout2 = layers.Dropout(rate)

    def call(self, inputs):
        input_shape = ops.shape(inputs)
        batch_size = input_shape[0]
        seq_len = input_shape[1]
        causal_mask = causal_attention_mask(batch_size, seq_len, seq_len, "bool")
        attention_output = self.att(inputs, inputs, attention_mask=causal_mask)
        attention_output = self.dropout1(attention_output)
        out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attention_output)
        ffn_output = self.ffn(out1)
        ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output)
        return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output)
```

## Implement an embedding layer

Create two separate embedding layers: one for tokens and one for token index (positions).

```python
class TokenAndPositionEmbedding(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.token_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embed_dim)
        self.pos_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=maxlen, output_dim=embed_dim)

    def call(self, x):
        maxlen = ops.shape(x)[-1]
        positions = ops.arange(0, maxlen, 1)
        positions = self.pos_emb(positions)
        x = self.token_emb(x)
        return x + positions
```

## Implement the miniature GPT model

```python
vocab_size = 20000  # Only consider the top 20k words
maxlen = 80  # Max sequence size
embed_dim = 256  # Embedding size for each token
num_heads = 2  # Number of attention heads
feed_forward_dim = 256  # Hidden layer size in feed forward network inside transformer


def create_model():
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(maxlen,), dtype="int32")
    embedding_layer = TokenAndPositionEmbedding(maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim)
    x = embedding_layer(inputs)
    transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, feed_forward_dim)
    x = transformer_block(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(vocab_size)(x)
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, x])
    loss_fn = keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
    model.compile(
        "adam",
        loss=[loss_fn, None],
    )  # No loss and optimization based on word embeddings from transformer block
    return model
```

## Prepare the data for word-level language modelling

Download the IMDB dataset and combine training and validation sets for a text generation task.

```python
!curl -O https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
!tar -xf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
```

```python
batch_size = 128

# The dataset contains each review in a separate text file
# The text files are present in four different folders
# Create a list all files
filenames = []
directories = [
    "aclImdb/train/pos",
    "aclImdb/train/neg",
    "aclImdb/test/pos",
    "aclImdb/test/neg",
]
for dir in directories:
    for f in os.listdir(dir):
        filenames.append(os.path.join(dir, f))

print(f"{len(filenames)} files")

# Create a dataset from text files
random.shuffle(filenames)
text_ds = tf_data.TextLineDataset(filenames)
text_ds = text_ds.shuffle(buffer_size=256)
text_ds = text_ds.batch(batch_size)


def custom_standardization(input_string):
    """Remove html line-break tags and handle punctuation"""
    lowercased = tf_strings.lower(input_string)
    stripped_html = tf_strings.regex_replace(lowercased, "<br />", " ")
    return tf_strings.regex_replace(stripped_html, f"([{string.punctuation}])", r" \1")


# Create a vectorization layer and adapt it to the text
vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(
    standardize=custom_standardization,
    max_tokens=vocab_size - 1,
    output_mode="int",
    output_sequence_length=maxlen + 1,
)
vectorize_layer.adapt(text_ds)
vocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()  # To get words back from token indices


def prepare_lm_inputs_labels(text):
    """
    Shift word sequences by 1 position so that the target for position (i) is
    word at position (i+1). The model will use all words up till position (i)
    to predict the next word.
    """
    text = tensorflow.expand_dims(text, -1)
    tokenized_sentences = vectorize_layer(text)
    x = tokenized_sentences[:, :-1]
    y = tokenized_sentences[:, 1:]
    return x, y


text_ds = text_ds.map(prepare_lm_inputs_labels, num_parallel_calls=tf_data.AUTOTUNE)
text_ds = text_ds.prefetch(tf_data.AUTOTUNE)
```

## Implement a Keras callback for generating text

```python
class TextGenerator(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    """A callback to generate text from a trained model.
    1. Feed some starting prompt to the model
    2. Predict probabilities for the next token
    3. Sample the next token and add it to the next input

    Arguments:
        max_tokens: Integer, the number of tokens to be generated after prompt.
        start_tokens: List of integers, the token indices for the starting prompt.

        self.k = top_k

    def sample_from(self, logits):
        logits, indices = ops.top_k(logits, k=self.k, sorted=True)
        indices = np.asarray(indices).astype("int32")
        preds = keras.activations.softmax(ops.expand_dims(logits, 0))[0]
        preds = np.asarray(preds).astype("float32")
        return np.random.choice(indices, p=preds)

    def detokenize(self, number):
        return self.index_to_word[number]

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        start_tokens = [_ for _ in self.start_tokens]
        if (epoch + 1) % self.print_every != 0:
            return
        num_tokens_generated = 0
        tokens_generated = []
        while num_tokens_generated <= self.max_tokens:
            pad_len = maxlen - len(start_tokens)
            sample_index = len(start_tokens) - 1
            if pad_len < 0:
                x = start_tokens[:maxlen]
                sample_index = maxlen - 1
            elif pad_len > 0:

            x = np.array([x])
            y, _ = self.model.predict(x, verbose=0)
            sample_token = self.sample_from(y[0][sample_index])
            tokens_generated.append(sample_token)

            num_tokens_generated = len(tokens_generated)

            [self.detokenize(_) for _ in self.start_tokens + tokens_generated]

## Train the model

Note: This code should preferably be run on GPU.

```python
model = create_model()

model.fit(text_ds, verbose=2, epochs=25, callbacks=[text_gen_callback])
```
