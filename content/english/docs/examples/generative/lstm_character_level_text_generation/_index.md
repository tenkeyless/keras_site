## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use a LSTM model to generate text character-by-character.

At least 20 epochs are required before the generated text starts sounding locally coherent.

It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent networks are quite computationally intensive.

If you try this script on new data, make sure your corpus has at least ~100k characters. ~1M is better.

## Setup

```python
import keras
from keras import layers

import numpy as np
import random
import io
```

## Prepare the data

```python
path = keras.utils.get_file(
    "nietzsche.txt",
    origin="https://s3.amazonaws.com/text-datasets/nietzsche.txt",
)
with io.open(path, encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read().lower()
text = text.replace("\n", " ")  # We remove newlines chars for nicer display
print("Corpus length:", len(text))

chars = sorted(list(set(text)))
print("Total chars:", len(chars))
char_indices = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))
indices_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))

# cut the text in semi-redundant sequences of maxlen characters
maxlen = 40
step = 3
sentences = []
next_chars = []
for i in range(0, len(text) - maxlen, step):
    sentences.append(text[i : i + maxlen])
    next_chars.append(text[i + maxlen])
print("Number of sequences:", len(sentences))

x = np.zeros((len(sentences), maxlen, len(chars)), dtype="bool")
y = np.zeros((len(sentences), len(chars)), dtype="bool")
for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
    for t, char in enumerate(sentence):
        x[i, t, char_indices[char]] = 1
    y[i, char_indices[next_chars[i]]] = 1
```

```plain
Corpus length: 600893
Total chars: 56
Number of sequences: 200285
```

{{% /details %}}

## Build the model: a single LSTM layer

```python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras.Input(shape=(maxlen, len(chars))),
        layers.LSTM(128),
        layers.Dense(len(chars), activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
optimizer = keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss="categorical_crossentropy", optimizer=optimizer)
```

## Prepare the text sampling function

```python
def sample(preds, temperature=1.0):
    # helper function to sample an index from a probability array
    preds = np.asarray(preds).astype("float64")
    preds = np.log(preds) / temperature
    exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
    preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
    probas = np.random.multinomial(1, preds, 1)
    return np.argmax(probas)
```

## Train the model

```python
epochs = 40
batch_size = 128

for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.fit(x, y, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=1)
    print()
    print("Generating text after epoch: %d" % epoch)

    start_index = random.randint(0, len(text) - maxlen - 1)
    for diversity in [0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2]:
        print("...Diversity:", diversity)

        generated = ""
        sentence = text[start_index : start_index + maxlen]
        print('...Generating with seed: "' + sentence + '"')

        for i in range(400):
            x_pred = np.zeros((1, maxlen, len(chars)))
            for t, char in enumerate(sentence):
                x_pred[0, t, char_indices[char]] = 1.0
            preds = model.predict(x_pred, verbose=0)[0]
            next_index = sample(preds, diversity)
            next_char = indices_char[next_index]
            sentence = sentence[1:] + next_char
            generated += next_char

        print("...Generated: ", generated)
        print("-")
```
