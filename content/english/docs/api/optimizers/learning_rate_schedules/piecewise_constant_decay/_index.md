### `PiecewiseConstantDecay` class

```python
keras.optimizers.schedules.PiecewiseConstantDecay(
    boundaries, values, name="PiecewiseConstant"
)
```

A `LearningRateSchedule` that uses a piecewise constant decay schedule.

The function returns a 1-arg callable to compute the piecewise constant
when passed the current optimizer step. This can be useful for changing the
learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.

**Example**

use a learning rate that's 1.0 for the first 100001 steps, 0.5
for the next 10000 steps, and 0.1 for any additional steps.

```python
step = ops.array(0)
boundaries = [100000, 110000]
values = [1.0, 0.5, 0.1]
learning_rate_fn = keras.optimizers.schedules.PiecewiseConstantDecay(
    boundaries, values)
learning_rate = learning_rate_fn(step)
```

You can pass this schedule directly into a [`keras.optimizers.Optimizer`]({{< relref "/docs/api/optimizers#optimizer-class" >}})
as the learning rate. The learning rate schedule is also serializable and
deserializable using `keras.optimizers.schedules.serialize` and
`keras.optimizers.schedules.deserialize`.

**Arguments**

- **boundaries**: A list of Python numbers with strictly increasing
  entries, and with all elements having the same type as the
  optimizer step.
- **values**: A list of Python numbers that specifies the values for the
  intervals defined by `boundaries`. It should have one more
  element than `boundaries`, and all elements should have the same
  type.
- **name**: A string. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to
  `"PiecewiseConstant"`.

**Returns**

A 1-arg callable learning rate schedule that takes the current optimizer
step and outputs the decayed learning rate, a scalar tensor of the
same type as the boundary tensors.

The output of the 1-arg function that takes the `step`
is `values[0]` when `step <= boundaries[0]`,
`values[1]` when `step > boundaries[0]` and `step <= boundaries[1]`,
..., and `values[-1]` when `step > boundaries[-1]`.

**Raises**

- **ValueError**: if the number of elements in the `boundaries` and `values`
  lists do not match.
