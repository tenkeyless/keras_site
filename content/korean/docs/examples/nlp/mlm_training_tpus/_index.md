## Introduction

In this example, we cover how to train a masked language model using TensorFlow, [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index), and TPUs.

TPU training is a useful skill to have: TPU pods are high-performance and extremely scalable, making it easy to train models at any scale from a few tens of millions of parameters up to truly enormous sizes: Google's PaLM model (over 500 billion parameters!) was trained entirely on TPU pods.

We've previously written a [**tutorial**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/perf_train_tpu_tf) and a [**Colab example**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb) showing small-scale TPU training with TensorFlow and introducing the core concepts you need to understand to get your model working on TPU. However, our Colab example doesn't contain all the steps needed to train a language model from scratch such as training the tokenizer. So, we wanted to provide a consolidated example of walking you through every critical step involved there.

As in our Colab example, we're taking advantage of TensorFlow's very clean TPU support via XLA and `TPUStrategy`. We'll also be benefiting from the fact that the majority of the TensorFlow models in ðŸ¤— Transformers are fully [XLA-compatible](https://huggingface.co/blog/tf-xla-generate). So surprisingly, little work is needed to get them to run on TPU.

This example is designed to be **scalable** and much closer to a realistic training run â€“ although we only use a BERT-sized model by default, the code could be expanded to a much larger model and a much more powerful TPU pod slice by changing a few configuration options.

The following diagram gives you a pictorial overview of the steps involved in training a language model with ðŸ¤— Transformers using TensorFlow and TPUs:

_(Contents of this example overlap with [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/tf_tpu))._

## Data

We use the [WikiText dataset (v1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext). You can head over to the [dataset page on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext) to explore the dataset.

![data_preview_wikitext](/images/examples/nlp/mlm_training_tpus/data_preview_wikitext.png)

Since the dataset is already available on the Hub in a compatible format, we can easily load and interact with it using [ðŸ¤— datasets](https://hf.co/docs/datasets). However, training a language model from scratch also requires a separate tokenizer training step. We skip that part in this example for brevity, but, here's a gist of what we can do to train a tokenizer from scratch:

- Load the `train` split of the WikiText using ðŸ¤— datasets.
- Leverage [ðŸ¤— tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index) to train a [**Unigram model**](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/7?fw=pt).
- Upload the trained tokenizer on the Hub.

You can find the tokenizer training code [**here**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu#training-a-tokenizer) and the tokenizer [**here**](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext). This script also allows you to run it with [**any compatible dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_ids=task_ids:language-modeling) from the Hub.

## Tokenizing the data and creating TFRecords

Once the tokenizer is trained, we can use it on all the dataset splits (`train`, `validation`, and `test` in this case) and create TFRecord shards out of them. Having the data splits spread across multiple TFRecord shards helps with massively parallel processing as opposed to having each split in single TFRecord files.

We tokenize the samples individually. We then take a batch of samples, concatenate them together, and split them into several chunks of a fixed size (128 in our case). We follow this strategy rather than tokenizing a batch of samples with a fixed length to avoid aggressively discarding text content (because of truncation).

We then take these tokenized samples in batches and serialize those batches as multiple TFRecord shards, where the total dataset length and individual shard size determine the number of shards. Finally, these shards are pushed to a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets).

If you're using a TPU node for training, then the data needs to be streamed from a GCS bucket since the node host memory is very small. But for TPU VMs, we can use datasets locally or even attach persistent storage to those VMs. Since TPU nodes (which is what we have in a Colab) are still quite heavily used, we based our example on using a GCS bucket for data storage.

You can see all of this in code in [this script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/prepare_tfrecord_shards.py). For convenience, we have also hosted the resultant TFRecord shards in [this repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tf-tpu/wikitext-v1-tfrecords) on the Hub.

Once the data is tokenized and serialized into TFRecord shards, we can proceed toward training.

## Training

### Setup and imports

Let's start by installing ðŸ¤— Transformers.

```python
!pip install transformers -q
```

Then, let's import the modules we need.

```python
import os
import re

import tensorflow as tf

import transformers
```

### Initialize TPUs

Then let's connect to our TPU and determine the distribution strategy:

```python
tpu = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()

tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(tpu)
tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(tpu)

strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(tpu)

print(f"Available number of replicas: {strategy.num_replicas_in_sync}")
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
Available number of replicas: 8
```

{{% /details %}}

We then load the tokenizer. For more details on the tokenizer, check out [its repository](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext). For the model, we use RoBERTa (the base variant), introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692).

### Initialize the tokenizer

```python
tokenizer = "tf-tpu/unigram-tokenizer-wikitext"
pretrained_model_config = "roberta-base"

tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer)
config = transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_config)
config.vocab_size = tokenizer.vocab_size
```

```

### Prepare the datasets

We now load the TFRecord shards of the WikiText dataset (which the Hugging Face team prepared beforehand for this example):

```python
train_dataset_path = "gs://tf-tpu-training-resources/train"
eval_dataset_path = "gs://tf-tpu-training-resources/validation"

training_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(train_dataset_path, "*.tfrecord"))
eval_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(eval_dataset_path, "*.tfrecord"))
```

Now, we will write a utility to count the number of training samples we have. We need to know this value in order properly initialize our optimizer later:

```python
def count_samples(file_list):
    num_samples = 0
    for file in file_list:
        filename = file.split("/")[-1]
        sample_count = re.search(r"-\d+-(\d+)\.tfrecord", filename).group(1)
        sample_count = int(sample_count)
        num_samples += sample_count

    return num_samples


num_train_samples = count_samples(training_records)
print(f"Number of total training samples: {num_train_samples}")
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
Number of total training samples: 300917
```

{{% /details %}}

Let's now prepare our datasets for training and evaluation. We start by writing our utilities. First, we need to be able to decode the TFRecords:

```python
max_sequence_length = 512


def decode_fn(example):
    features = {
        "input_ids": tf.io.FixedLenFeature(
            dtype=tf.int64, shape=(max_sequence_length,)
        ),
        "attention_mask": tf.io.FixedLenFeature(
            dtype=tf.int64, shape=(max_sequence_length,)
        ),
    }
    return tf.io.parse_single_example(example, features)
```

Here, `max_sequence_length` needs to be the same as the one used during preparing the TFRecord shards.Refer to [this script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/prepare_tfrecord_shards.py) for more details.

Next up, we have our masking utility that is responsible for masking parts of the inputs and preparing labels for the masked language model to learn from. We leverage the [`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.1/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling) for this purpose.

```python
# We use a standard masking probability of 0.15. `mlm_probability` denotes
# probability with which we mask the input tokens in a sequence.
mlm_probability = 0.15
data_collator = transformers.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm_probability=mlm_probability, mlm=True, return_tensors="tf"
)


def mask_with_collator(batch):
    special_tokens_mask = (
        ~tf.cast(batch["attention_mask"], tf.bool)
        | (batch["input_ids"] == tokenizer.cls_token_id)
        | (batch["input_ids"] == tokenizer.sep_token_id)
    )
    batch["input_ids"], batch["labels"] = data_collator.tf_mask_tokens(
        batch["input_ids"],
        vocab_size=len(tokenizer),
        mask_token_id=tokenizer.mask_token_id,
        special_tokens_mask=special_tokens_mask,
    )
    return batch
```

And now is the time to write the final data preparation utility to put it all together in a [`tf.data.Dataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset) object:

```python
auto = tf.data.AUTOTUNE
shuffle_buffer_size = 2**18


def prepare_dataset(
    records, decode_fn, mask_fn, batch_size, shuffle, shuffle_buffer_size=None
):
    num_samples = count_samples(records)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(records)
    if shuffle:
        dataset = dataset.shuffle(len(dataset))
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(dataset, num_parallel_reads=auto)
    # TF can't infer the total sample count because it doesn't read
    #  all the records yet, so we assert it here.
    dataset = dataset.apply(tf.data.experimental.assert_cardinality(num_samples))
    dataset = dataset.map(decode_fn, num_parallel_calls=auto)
    if shuffle:
        assert shuffle_buffer_size is not None
        dataset = dataset.shuffle(shuffle_buffer_size)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True)
    dataset = dataset.map(mask_fn, num_parallel_calls=auto)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(auto)
    return dataset
```

Let's prepare our datasets with these utilities:

```python
per_replica_batch_size = 16  # Change as needed.
batch_size = per_replica_batch_size * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
shuffle_buffer_size = 2**18  # Default corresponds to a 1GB buffer for seq_len 512

train_dataset = prepare_dataset(
    training_records,
    decode_fn=decode_fn,
    mask_fn=mask_with_collator,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=True,
    shuffle_buffer_size=shuffle_buffer_size,
)

eval_dataset = prepare_dataset(
    eval_records,
    decode_fn=decode_fn,
    mask_fn=mask_with_collator,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=False,
)
```

Let's now investigate how a single batch of dataset looks like.

```python
single_batch = next(iter(train_dataset))
print(single_batch.keys())
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
dict_keys(['attention_mask', 'input_ids', 'labels'])
```

{{% /details %}}

- `input_ids` denotes the tokenized versions of the input samples containing the mask tokens as well.
- `attention_mask` denotes the mask to be used when performing attention operations.
- `labels` denotes the actual values of masked tokens the model is supposed to learn from.

```python
for k in single_batch:
    if k == "input_ids":
        input_ids = single_batch[k]
        print(f"Input shape: {input_ids.shape}")
    if k == "labels":
        labels = single_batch[k]
        print(f"Label shape: {labels.shape}")
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
Input shape: (128, 512)
Label shape: (128, 512)
```

{{% /details %}}

Now, we can leverage our `tokenizer` to investigate the values of the tokens. Let's start with `input_ids`:

```python
idx = 0
print("Taking the first sample:\n")
print(tokenizer.decode(input_ids[idx].numpy()))
```

As expected, the decoded tokens contain the special tokens including the mask tokens as well. Let's now investigate the mask tokens:

```python
# Taking the first 30 tokens of the first sequence.
print(labels[0].numpy()[:30])
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
[-100 -100 -100 -100 -100 -100 -100 -100 -100   43 -100 -100 -100 -100

 -100 -100]
```

{{% /details %}}

Here, `-100` means that the corresponding tokens in the `input_ids` are NOT masked and non `-100` values denote the actual values of the masked tokens.

## Initialize the mode and and the optimizer

With the datasets prepared, we now initialize and compile our model and optimizer within the `strategy.scope()`:

```python
# For this example, we keep this value to 10. But for a realistic run, start with 500.
num_epochs = 10
steps_per_epoch = num_train_samples // (
    per_replica_batch_size * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
)
total_train_steps = steps_per_epoch * num_epochs
learning_rate = 0.0001
weight_decay_rate = 1e-3

with strategy.scope():
    model = transformers.TFAutoModelForMaskedLM.from_config(config)
    model(
        model.dummy_inputs
    )  # Pass some dummy inputs through the model to ensure all the weights are built
    optimizer, schedule = transformers.create_optimizer(
        num_train_steps=total_train_steps,
        num_warmup_steps=total_train_steps // 20,
        init_lr=learning_rate,
        weight_decay_rate=weight_decay_rate,
    )
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, metrics=["accuracy"])
```

{{% details title="Result" closed="true" %}}

```plain
No loss specified in compile() - the model's internal loss computation will be used as the loss. Don't panic - this is a common way to train TensorFlow models in Transformers! To disable this behaviour please pass a loss argument, or explicitly pass `loss=None` if you do not want your model to compute a loss.
```

{{% /details %}}

A couple of things to note here: \* The [`create_optimizer()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules#transformers.create_optimizer) function creates an Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule using a warmup phase followed by a linear decay. Since we're using weight decay here, under the hood, `create_optimizer()` instantiates [the right variant of Adam](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/118e9810687dd713b6be07af79e80eeb1d916908/src/transformers/optimization_tf.py#L172) to enable weight decay. \* While compiling the model, we're NOT using any `loss` argument. This is because the TensorFlow models internally compute the loss when expected labels are provided. Based on the model type and the labels being used, `transformers` will automatically infer the loss to use.

### Start training!

Next, we set up a handy callback to push the intermediate training checkpoints to the Hugging Face Hub. To be able to operationalize this callback, we need to log in to our Hugging Face account (if you don't have one, you create one [here](https://huggingface.co/join) for free). Execute the code below for logging in:

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

Let's now define the [`PushToHubCallback`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/keras_callbacks#transformers.PushToHubCallback):

```python
hub_model_id = output_dir = "masked-lm-tpu"

callbacks = []
callbacks.append(
    transformers.PushToHubCallback(
        output_dir=output_dir, hub_model_id=hub_model_id, tokenizer=tokenizer
    )
)
```

And now, we're ready to chug the TPUs:

```python
# In the interest of the runtime of this example,
# we limit the number of batches to just 2.

    train_dataset.take(2),
    validation_data=eval_dataset.take(2),

Once your training is complete, you can easily perform inference like so:

from transformers import pipeline

# Replace your `model_id` here.
# Here, we're using a model that the Hugging Face team trained for longer.
model_id = "tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd"
