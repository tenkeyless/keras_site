### `Lambda` class

```python
keras.layers.Lambda(function, output_shape=None, mask=None, arguments=None, **kwargs)
```

Wraps arbitrary expressions as a `Layer` object.

The `Lambda` layer exists so that arbitrary expressions can be used as a `Layer` when constructing Sequential and Functional API models. `Lambda` layers are best suited for simple operations or quick experimentation. For more advanced use cases, prefer writing new subclasses of `Layer`.

WARNING: `Lambda` layers have (de)serialization limitations!

The main reason to subclass `Layer` instead of using a `Lambda` layer is saving and inspecting a model. `Lambda` layers are saved by serializing the Python bytecode, which is fundamentally non-portable and potentially unsafe. They should only be loaded in the same environment where they were saved. Subclassed layers can be saved in a more portable way by overriding their `get_config()` method. Models that rely on subclassed Layers are also often easier to visualize and reason about.

**Example**

```python
# add a x -> x^2 layer
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x ** 2))
```

**Arguments**

- **function**: The function to be evaluated. Takes input tensor as first argument.
- **output_shape**: Expected output shape from function. This argument can usually be inferred if not explicitly provided. Can be a tuple or function. If a tuple, it only specifies the first dimension onward; sample dimension is assumed either the same as the input: `output_shape = (input_shape[0], ) + output_shape` or, the input is `None` and the sample dimension is also `None`: `output_shape = (None, ) + output_shape`. If a function, it specifies the entire shape as a function of the input shape: `output_shape = f(input_shape)`.
- **mask**: Either None (indicating no masking) or a callable with the same signature as the `compute_mask` layer method, or a tensor that will be returned as output mask regardless of what the input is.
- **arguments**: Optional dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the function.
