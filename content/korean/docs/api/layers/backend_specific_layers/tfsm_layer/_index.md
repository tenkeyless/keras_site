### `TFSMLayer` class

```python
keras.layers.TFSMLayer(
    filepath,
    call_endpoint="serve",
    call_training_endpoint=None,
    trainable=True,
    name=None,
    dtype=None,
)
```

Reload a Keras model/layer that was saved via SavedModel / ExportArchive.

**Arguments**

- **filepath**: `str` or `pathlib.Path` object. The path to the SavedModel.
- **call_endpoint**: Name of the endpoint to use as the `call()` method
  of the reloaded layer. If the SavedModel was created
  via `model.export()`,
  then the default endpoint name is `'serve'`. In other cases
  it may be named `'serving_default'`.

**Example**

```python
model.export("path/to/artifact")
reloaded_layer = TFSMLayer("path/to/artifact")
outputs = reloaded_layer(inputs)
```

The reloaded object can be used like a regular Keras layer, and supports
training/fine-tuning of its trainable weights. Note that the reloaded
object retains none of the internal structure or custom methods of the
original object â€“ it's a brand new layer created around the saved
function.

**Limitations:**

- Only call endpoints with a single `inputs` tensor argument
  (which may optionally be a dict/tuple/list of tensors) are supported.
  For endpoints with multiple separate input tensor arguments, consider
  subclassing `TFSMLayer` and implementing a `call()` method with a
  custom signature.
- If you need training-time behavior to differ from inference-time behavior
  (i.e. if you need the reloaded object to support a `training=True` argument
  in `__call__()`), make sure that the training-time call function is
  saved as a standalone endpoint in the artifact, and provide its name
  to the `TFSMLayer` via the `call_training_endpoint` argument.
