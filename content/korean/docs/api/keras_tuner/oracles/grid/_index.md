### `GridSearchOracle` class

```python
keras_tuner.oracles.GridSearchOracle(
    objective=None,
    max_trials=None,
    seed=None,
    hyperparameters=None,
    allow_new_entries=True,
    tune_new_entries=True,
    max_retries_per_trial=0,
    max_consecutive_failed_trials=3,
)
```

Grid search oracle.

**Arguments**

- **objective**: A string, [`keras_tuner.Objective`]({{< relref "/docs/api/keras_tuner/tuners/objective#objective-class" >}}) instance, or a list of
  [`keras_tuner.Objective`]({{< relref "/docs/api/keras_tuner/tuners/objective#objective-class" >}})s and strings. If a string, the direction of
  the optimization (min or max) will be inferred. If a list of
  [`keras_tuner.Objective`]({{< relref "/docs/api/keras_tuner/tuners/objective#objective-class" >}}), we will minimize the sum of all the
  objectives to minimize subtracting the sum of all the objectives to
  maximize. The `objective` argument is optional when
  `Tuner.run_trial()` or `HyperModel.fit()` returns a single float as
  the objective to minimize.
- **max_trials**: Optional integer, the total number of trials (model
  configurations) to test at most. Note that the oracle may interrupt
  the search before `max_trial` models have been tested if the search
  space has been exhausted. If left unspecified, it runs till the
  search space is exhausted.
- **seed**: Optional integer, the random seed.
- **hyperparameters**: Optional `HyperParameters` instance. Can be used to
  override (or register in advance) hyperparameters in the search
  space.
- **tune_new_entries**: Boolean, whether hyperparameter entries that are
  requested by the hypermodel but that were not specified in
  `hyperparameters` should be added to the search space, or not. If
  not, then the default value for these parameters will be used.
  Defaults to True.
- **allow_new_entries**: Boolean, whether the hypermodel is allowed to
  request hyperparameter entries not listed in `hyperparameters`.
  Defaults to True.
- **max_retries_per_trial**: Integer. Defaults to 0. The maximum number of
  times to retry a `Trial` if the trial crashed or the results are
  invalid.
- **max_consecutive_failed_trials**: Integer. Defaults to 3. The maximum
  number of consecutive failed `Trial`s. When this number is reached,
  the search will be stopped. A `Trial` is marked as failed when none
  of the retries succeeded.
